# 🔐 Keylogger Project - Task 04

This is **Task 04** of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**, where I developed a **basic keylogger in Python** that records and logs every keystroke typed on the keyboard and saves them to a file.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

Create a keylogger that:
- Captures every key press (including special keys).
- Logs them in a readable format.
- Saves the output to a local text file (`log.txt`).

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Captures regular keys (`a`, `b`, `1`, etc.).
- Captures special keys (`Enter`, `Backspace`, `Shift`, etc.).
- Stores keystrokes in a local log file.
- Runs silently in the background.


## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **pynput** library (for listening to keyboard events)
- Visual Studio Code (development environment)


## 🚀 Getting Started
